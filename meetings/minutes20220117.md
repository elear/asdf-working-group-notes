# ASDF Next Steps

Three pull requests pending: #45, #36, (#49,#50), #52, 

## PR45 - single in/out
    * partially revert SDF 1.1 single-in/out.  
    * Recommendation: WONTFIX.
    * Pro: we would get SDF names for all things, out to individual parameters.

AK: Do we need this feature? Is there a way to get this feature without the type:object construct?
MK: JSON pointer does go through the properties. It is possible we could have it both ways, and when there is a single parameter, it could be simpler.
        Does not think it matters that much, and does not have a good use case. Agreeing with wontfix.

AK: Let's go with wontfix, but let's write down what these pointers look like. 
ACTION: Write a few examples.

## PR 36 - sdfRef Clarifications

Do the clarifications, but do not do sdfRefFrom.
Use another definition as a template with a way to override it, only requires one keyword (with some rules)

An extension, then not in this document. In a future document (extension or revision to this)

_It's a form of "isA"_
    _mightBeA_ instead of _isA_
    _isARefinementOf_
 
ACTION: But, the sdfRef process needs to be clarified in this (1.x) document.
 
## PR 49, 50.  "sdfProduct"

An additional _quality_ is that it's a completed product.... 
People have asked for an sdfSKU...

* believed that sdfThing could do all of this, and we added sdfSKU to this for that reason.
* _how do I compose a bunch of IPSO smart objects into a product?_ 
* it got written in when it was easy to do, but now makes less sense, and should be removed. MK does not think it needs to be a language feature.

ACTION: accept these PRs to remove sdfProduct.

## PR 52. dataqualities, r/w/o

These really describe interactions, not the data!
Suggest moving up to affordance level, but not so easy.

YANG has configTrue/configFalse. Separate constructs for actions (rpc), and events (notifications).
AK: probably easier to later add it, rather than to remove it.  So only have it for properties now.
* proposed to adopt PR.
ACTION: document what is the potential downside.

# plan for SDF2 

* extension points needs to be documented in SDF1
    * adding qualities
* deeper extensions... newer namespaces.


ACTION: WGLC version by the end of January.
ACTION: post -11 with all lines wrapped

# IETF113

No meeting at IETF113 (Vienna), as most participants are not travelling.
    * further virtual interim meetings,
