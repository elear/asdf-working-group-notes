* Multi-instance sdfThings

    i.e. an outlet strip with four outlets.
    We need to be able say that there are multiple instances.
    (If you use `items` in there, then there is no limit)
   By default it's 0 or 1. With sdfRequired it's 1. With min/max items can set min or max. 

PR # 12 - https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/12

MCR: have registry that accepts URIs? FCFS. Would at least find something someone has already done.

CB: would be third registry. SenML registry is short strings. 

MCR: suggested that we have a registry that accepts URIs.

AK: suggests that the URI point to something that defines the units.

(For "slug" unit use see: https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md#semantic-types )
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(unit)

MCR: URIs would be for units that don't fit to the SenML registry

CB: with SenML you can write code that can handle any unit. 2nd registry refers to the primary one with math equation. The primary registry will move very slowly. That's going to be different with URIs.

CB: will go with Michael's proposal we have our own registry for URIs. With pointint to namespace. Example with DTDLv2 has already fragment ID in it. Would be strong recommendation to use SenML units and if not possible, use this.

AK: could pre-register a few sensible sources, like [ucum](https://ucum.org/ucum.html) and [OM2](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/)
     
     
Issue # 26 - https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/26
    SPDX is the preferred reference to describe the licenses involved. 
    
AK: can put all values in array from all sources?
MCR: Not all licenses are combinable (legal reasons)


Issue # 27 - https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/27
    
AK: Looks good. Could also put the removing-field feature (null values) to next version if it gets tricky to define here


Issue # 30 - https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/30  --- pull request, seemed fine.

Issue # 28 - https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/28
    take to mailing list.
