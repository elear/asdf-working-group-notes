      https://github.com/one-data-model/SDF/issues ðŸ¡¡
      https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues
      
Much discussion about choices and examples.
"brightnessWithColorTone" (slide 13)
CB will generate the example first, and then once we have consensus on it, generate the text that goes around it.

Aggregation discussion:
    proposal makes sense, but needs running code.
    
[slide16]: issue/3: share elements inside and outside spec
    use JSON pointers, but haven't tested this out.
    
[slide17]: length, can be no negative lengths, but sometimes,
    "has a minimum of 5cm"
    -> slide18, uses the datatype, and is then extended.
    
[slide19]: Ari will write some comments about "level", in particular as to how it relates to UIs.
    Noted how light and sound have non-linear ranges (db, )
    
SDF 1.1 features slide.
    * first strawmen by the end of November.
    * all of December to nail this down.
    
How can we reach out to other IoT ecosystems, and find out how to do this?
* OPC UA?
* Automotive ecosystem?
