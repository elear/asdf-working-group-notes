### 3. WG status update (Chairs - 10 min)				
#### 3a. Welcome and discussion of WG proceedures
     
[slides 6, 7, 8, 9]
Questions: 
Michael Koster quite a bit of external input to the model (4+ named). 
So the requirements that were collected were very broad, but we need to finish the language before we can ask them to come back and contribute models.
Discussion about RFC vs Implementation Draft.

### 4. SDF 1.1

#### 4a. Issues
https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/3
https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/4
    ACTION: create wiki page on what the different ecosystems are dealing with converation to/from SDF.
    MK: mapping files (leverages JSON pointer).... also inline extension points.
    WvdB: already a web page: https://onedm.org/terminology/
    "pressure test" now needed.
    
https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/7    - sdfRef issue
"This thing is like that thing, but this restriction does not apply"
 How can we set that part to "null"?
    _What if you do it the other way around? Then it is an extend!_
    Subtypes vs overrides.
 Declaration vs Definition distinction.
    CB: When you say "override"... would it be okay to define RGB, and then override...with a different colour scheme? (Answer NO)
    When say motor speed 0..255, but then restrict to 0..50.
    Convention that override is only used for subtyping, new type should be a subtype.
     thus, we don't need to set qualities for null.
     
 https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/2
 https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/issues/5
 enum and anyOf
 and mixes!
    
 Data Model vs Info Model
 The problem is reusing syntax from data modelling to do information modelling.
   YES: sdfChoice:  https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/pull/8
    
   . o O ( what MCR hears is that pure JSO pointer has to be extended, so no common code )
   SK points to: https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/997
   consensus proposal: do not deprecate JSON Schema ORG ENUM, but *do* include solution for MK need.  Will go into #8.
      
### 5. W3C Web of Things collaboration 

Sebastian presented WoT and the SDF to WoT converter he has. Discussion of potential use of SDF with WoT TD models

https://github.com/roman-kravtsov/sdf-object-converter

Kaz mentios the [W3C liaison table for IETF](https://www.w3.org/2001/11/StdLiaison#IETF) and suggests further discussin by email.

*Ran out of time - will continue discussion on mailing list.*
